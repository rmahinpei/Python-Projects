# Purpose
My goal with the projects in this repo was to apply the skills I learned through Stanford University’s Code in Place, an intro-to-coding program designed during the time of COVID-19 that is equivalent to Stanford’s CS106A.
## Projects
Here is a short description about each project in this repo.
* **BAC**: a deterministic compartmental model tracking an individual's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over time. The pathway of alcohol within the model was proposed by my friend, Stephanie Lapadat.
* **OnTrack**: an interactive Python program that allows the user to keep track of their food consumption (option 1), physical activity (option 2), and water intake (option 3). The user can also check their logs throughout the day (option 4) and finally calculate their total at the end of the day (option 5). To learn more about the program, feel free to watch my [demo video](https://youtu.be/ySRz24RFVrE).
* **WeightLoss**: an implementation of the deterministic model of weight loss proposed by Diana M. Thomas et al. Feel free to read the [original paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2764961/) to learn more about the details of the model.
## Note
Sometimes GitHub has issues with displaying ipynb files. If this is the case, feel free to check out the code by looking at the raw file.
